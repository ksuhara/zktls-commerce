# zkTLS Commerce

zkTLS Commerce is an e-commerce site that sells products only to users who submit zkProofs using zkTLS.

The zkTLS protocol uses zkPass, while Shopify serves as the e-commerce backend. If a product's Metafield in Shopify contains a zkPass App ID, the corresponding proof requirement is displayed. This allows different proof conditions to be set for each product.

The demo video below showcases a product that can only be purchased by users with specific Notion access permissions.
